## Task 1: Setup

- Create a new React app:
  `npx create-react-app twootr`
  ➡️ you can change the app name if wanted.
- Install dependencies:
  `cd twootr`
  `npm install axios styled-components`
- Clean the project, removing all the unnecessary files.
- Add proxy to `package.json` file.
- Run the app to check if no errors:
  `npm start`
- Create a new folder `frontend` and move the whole application inside that.
- Initialize node in the root of the project
  `npm init -y`
- Install server dependencies
  `npm install express cors uuid axios nodemon concurrently`
- Add type in `package.json`
  `"type":"module"`
- Add scripts in `package.json`
- Create new file `server.js` and copy + paste from this [link](https://gist.github.com/adlascio/d0b7cf0fb62ced40d21b75264dfbe759)
- Run the app to check if no errors
  `npm run dev`

```json
    "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "server": "nodemon server.js",
    "client": "cd frontend && npm start",
    "dev": "concurrently  \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
  }
```

## Task 2: Make a plan

- Create the file `PLAN.md`
- Must include topics:
  - User Stories / Job Stories
  - Data Structure
  - HTML Structure
  - Component Structure
  - Data Map
  - Styling Patterns (Fonts and Colors)

> You can use as a reference the file created in class for myTrakr exercise.

## Task 3: HTML Structure

- Based on the mockup file, create all the elements of the page in the render of App Component (`App.js`).

## Task 4: Component Structure

- Create a new folder called `components` inside `src` folder.
- Break your HTML structure into small Components and create a file for each of these Components.
  > To follow best practices, you should name each file with first letter upper case. Ex: `App.js`, `NewTwoot.js`, etc.
  > You can choose to use `.js` or `.jsx` files for Components.
- Add the respective HTML inside each file.

## Task 5: States

- Based on your data map, create the states in the Components that will hold the data and pass it down to child components using `props`.

## Task 6: Get data from server

- Make an API request using Axios to get all the _twoots_ saved in the server.
- Update the state with the new data.

## Task 7: Render data

- Calculate how many days ago the _twoot_ was posted. If 0 days, show `posted today`
- Using the data stored in the each state, render it on the UI.

## Task 8: Update state

- Add event listeners for each of the elements that you need to track. For example: Twoot input, character counter, etc.
- Update the state with the new values.

## Task 9: Submit new Twoot

- In case of empty _twoot_ or over 140 characters, twoot button should be disabled and submit should not happen.
- Make a post request using Axios, including the data to be saved.
- After response received, update _twoots_ list in the state.

## Task 10: UI Interactions

- When the user clicks on the `write a new text`, it should focus on the input.
- When the user hovers the twoot, it should change the styling based on the mockup.
- When the user clicks on the icons (🏳️, 🔄, 💗), it should change the styling.

## Task 11: Styled Components

- Update or create styles using Styled Components.

## Task 12: Prepare your presentation

- Show `PLAN.md` file, explaining your decisions
- How was the project divided?
- What you learned?
- What you struggled the most?
- What would you have done differently?
